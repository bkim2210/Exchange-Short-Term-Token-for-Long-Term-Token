Retrieve API Credentials:

The getCreds function initializes a dictionary containing various credentials and parameters needed to make requests to the Facebook Graph API. This includes access tokens, client ID, client secret, and other necessary information.
Make API Calls:

The makeApiCall function is a generic function for making GET requests to the Facebook Graph API. It takes a URL, endpoint parameters, and an optional debug flag. It returns the response from the API in a structured dictionary format.
Debug Access Token:

The debugAccessToken function checks the validity and expiration details of an access token by making a request to the Facebook Graph API's debug_token endpoint. It prints out the URL, endpoint parameters, and response details.
Display Token Expiry:

After debugging the access token, the script prints the expiration timestamp of the token in a human-readable format.
Get Long-Lived Access Token:

The getLongLivedAccessToken function requests a long-lived access token by exchanging a short-lived access token. This is achieved by making a request to the oauth/access_token endpoint.
Display Access Token Info:

The script then prints information about the obtained long-lived access token, including the access token itself.
Note:

The script includes placeholders (e.g., 'Enter Token') for sensitive information such as access tokens, client IDs, and client secrets. These placeholders should be replaced with actual values.
Comments:

Throughout the code, comments are provided to explain the purpose of each function, variable, and section, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the script as needed.
